This file contains the core data structures of the application:

- SiteFile      -> SiteTree       -> SiteFileZipper
- PageReference -> PageTree       -> PageZipper
- SyncReference -> ConfluenceTree -> ConfluenceZipper

Site File
=========

A site file represents a local file that exists within the directory being
synced. The reason for the data structure is to materialise whether it is a
directory (which would otherwise require an IO action) and to capture a
consistent snapshot of the filesystem (because otherwise local mutations could
introduce a class of errors that would not otherwise be present - and instead we
simply fail when accessing a file rather than having an "incorrect" result).

The site tree simply represents all the files and directories in the sync root.

Page Reference
==============

Not every file in the directory generates a page, and not every page corresponds
to a single file. For example, assets, such as images do not result in new
Confluence pages being created.

Similarly, directories, whilst not having content
themselves may instead be "replaced" with a README.md or README.html that is at
the root of the directory. E.g. for /foo - a Confluence page will be created where /foo is but with the
content from /foo/README.md.

As a result, every page reference has a reference to its actual site file - which
represents where it should lie in the hierarchy of pages, and a reference to where
it should actually get its content from.

In the event a directory uses a file's contents - then instead of creating the file,
a shadow reference is generated instead. This allows us to detect that the page's
contents have already been rendered and we only render the page once. For example,
if we have /foo from the example above (with content from /foo/README.md), we don't
also want to separately render the same content at /foo/README.md.

The shadow reference is useful however for resolving links and other paths because we
can look it up based on the page reference (e.g. a link to /foo/README.html can be
redirected to /foo based on the shadow reference).

Sync Reference
==============

A sync reference pairs an actual page on Confluence (e.g. with its id, url and
related data) with a Page Reference. Once we have both of these, we can resolve
links between pages and provide more of the advanced functionality.

Only actual page references (not shadow references) have a sync reference entry.

Zippers
=======

All of the aforementioned data structures form trees logically - whether its
Confluence page hierarchies or folders/files on the file system.

The reason zippers are used is to allow lookups and references based on the
position of a page or file in the hierarchy.

For example, it allows a page to quickly ascertain the Confluence page id of its
parent to ensure that it is positioned correctly. Similarly, it allows for relative
lookups based on links (e.g. ../bar.img can resolve based on the parents location).
